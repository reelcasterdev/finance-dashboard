## 📈 Understanding the Indicators

### MVRV Ratio (28% weight)
- **What it shows:** Market Value / Realized Value
- **> 3.5:** Overheated market, potential top
- **< 1.0:** Undervalued market, potential bottom

### Long-Term Holder Supply (18% weight)
- **What it shows:** % of Bitcoin held > 155 days
- **> 75%:** High HODLing, often precedes tops
- **< 55%:** Distribution phase, often at bottoms

### Puell Multiple (16% weight)
- **What it shows:** Miner revenue vs 365-day average
- **> 4:** Miners highly profitable, potential top
- **< 0.5:** Miner capitulation, potential bottom

### Miner Position Index (10% weight)
- **What it shows:** Miner selling pressure
- **> 2:** Heavy miner selling
- **< 0.5:** Miners accumulating

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If indicators still show mock data:

1. **Check API Key is set:**
   ```bash
   cat .env.local | grep BITCOIN_MAGAZINE_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Check API responses:**
   ```bash
   # Should return real data, not mock
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/indicators/mvrv | jq .
   ```

4. **Check console for errors:**
   Look for any error messages in the terminal where you run `pnpm dev`

### Common Issues:

- **401 Unauthorized:** API key is invalid
- **429 Rate Limited:** Too many requests, wait a few minutes
- **Network Error:** Check internet connection
